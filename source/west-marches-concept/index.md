## West Marches concept

Map consists of areas, that in turn consist of hexagons/tiles that players advance through one by one. Each time they enter a tile, they trigger new event, either beneficial or detrimental to them. 

Areas have determined set of monsters/animals that live there and set of environmental 
hazards that can occur to players. When entering a tile, GM throw a dice for hazard, dice for monsters and combine these two to create unique combat. Third dice helps GM determine who should be affected by hazard, monsters or players. These tables, dice throws and monster's HP should be hidden from players but every other stat about monsters need be known. All GM's dice need to be rolled out in the open and percent of monster's HP remaining (but not actual HP) should be known at all times.

Each tile is 3 miles across, meaning they can cross it in an hour and deal with event on the way. Normal traveling pace assumes 8 hours of walking, meaning players can cross 8 tiles or 24 miles (or just shy of 40km). If they choose to travel longer or faster, they can do that as described in PHB (p. 181).

Throughout world there are ruins, caves and monster lairs, waiting to be explored. Some of them are well known (although their exact location can be unknown) and some of them players will stumble upon by accident.
