## 22. 2. 2019

(Session on radioactive island)

* Images on the wall
  * Tri risbe
    1. Črna kača, iz nje ven pušcica proti drugi risbi
    2. Skica človeške glave. Oči glave so čisto črne
    3. Prerez človeške glave. Na sredini, kjer bi morali biti možgani, je samo črna kača.
  * En kup črnih kač narisanih, iz vseh njih gre puščica, ki se nato združi v eno veliko puščico. Ta velika puščica kaže na veliko rjavo pošast (najbolj spominja na blob monster)
  * Rjava pošast narisana, poleg je narisan sword prečrtan, puščica prečrtana, hamer prečrtan.
  * Rjava pošast narisana, poleg so narisani valovi in zraven zelena kljukica, potem pa je narisana rumena oblika (izgleda kot otok) in rdeči X zraven
  * Rjava pošast narisana, iz nje gredo lovke, vsaka lovka drži polovico ladje
  * Črna kača z belo piko (kao oka) + [This image](poison.png) = črna kača z belim X namesto oke

## 11. 1. 2019

(Session with mountain climbing and exploring of Deepwood mountain temple)

* Branjimir still has white shards collected in the temple
* Illustrations in the temple:
    1. Humanoid creature in the center of the image (illustration is very crude, barely above stick figure level. Race cannot be determined from the image, except the fact that figure is taller than average dwarf or halfling) smiling mischievously. Around him skeletons are bowing to him
    2. Xenophilious stone on the left. There are red squigly lines coming off the stone to the humanoid figure that is covering its eyes, experiencing pain
    3. Illustration consists of three images:
        1. Cross section of an errupting vulcano with Xenophilious stone inside the center of the vulcano. There is a green tick mark next to it. 
        2. Image of a blazing fire with Xenophilious stone in the center of the fire. There is a green tick mark next to it.  
        3. Parf ot the image has been destroyed (there is noticeable chunk of wall missing) and there is red `X` mark next to the destroyed part
    4. Illustration of a house. Inside the house there is a cozy room with fireplace burning. In the room there is a locked chest. Inside chest sits Xenophilious stone. A bit further from the house there is humanoid figure with raised hands. Purple straight lines are coming from its hand to the guard that is cowering on the ground, being obviously in pain.
* Rooms in the temple:
    * Crypt room with coffins on the side and big pile of ash in the center
    * Container room with the stone stand that held metalic container containing white shards
    * Room with the teleportation circle
